If you use two placeholders in the first argument to
`PG::Connection#exec_params`, but only one in the Array of values used to fill
in those placeholders, an error is raised:

```sql
PG::AmbiguousFunction: ERROR:  operator is not unique: unknown + unknown
LINE 1: SELECT $1 + $2
                  ^
HINT:  Could not choose a best candidate operator. You might need to add explicit type casts.
```

<!-- LS -->

```sql
connection.exec_params("SELECT position($1 in $2)", ["t"]).values
PG::ProtocolViolation: ERROR:  bind message supplies 1 parameters, but prepared statement "" requires 2

        from (irb):9:in `exec_params'
        from (irb):9
